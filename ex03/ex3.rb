# Exercise 3

# Statement
puts "I will now count my chickens:"
# Calculates the total number of hens
puts "Hens #{25.0 + 30.0 / 6.0}"
# Calculates the total number of roosters
puts "Roosters #{100.0 - 25.0 * 3.0 % 4.0}"
# Statement
puts "Now I will count the eggs:"
# Calculates the total number of eggs
puts 3.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 - 5.0 + 4.0 % 2.0 - 1.0 / 4.0 + 6.0
# Question
puts "Is it true that 3.0 + 2.0 < 5.0 - 7.0?"
# Calculation proving whether the above is true or false
puts 3.0 + 2.0 < 5.0 - 7.0
# Equations proving why
puts "What is 3.0 + 2.0? #{3.0 + 2.0}"
puts "What is 5.0 - 7.0? #{5.0 - 7.0}"
# Statement
puts "Oh, that's why it's false."
# Statement
puts "How about some more."
# Questions and equations providing the answers. 
# The '#{}' executes the equation and provides the answer - either true or false. 
puts "Is it greater? #{5.0 > -2.0}"
puts "Is it greater or equal? #{5.0 >= -2.0}"
puts "Is it less or equal? #{5.0 <= -2.0}"
