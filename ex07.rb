# Exercise 7

# prints string
puts "Mary had a little lamb."
# prints string with embedded string 'snow'
puts "Its fleece was white as #{'snow'}."
# prints string
puts "And everywhere that Mary went."
# Prints ten dots (The string ten times)
puts "." * 10 # what'd that do? 

# These are all variables with assigned values. 
end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r" 

# watch that print vs. puts on this line what's it do? 
# It keeps them both on the same line.  If they were both puts, they'd be on two lines.
# If they were both print, there'd be no gap at the end. 
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6
puts end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12
