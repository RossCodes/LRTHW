Alright, so you said #{likes} about liking me.
You live in #{lives}. Not sure where that is.

# We make a variable 'prompt' that is set to the prompt we want, and we give that
# to gets.chomp instead of typing it over and over.  
# Now if we want to make the prompt something else, we just have to change
# it in this one spot and rerun the script. Very handy. 

# ARGV.first is used to get just one argument.  Reasons for this are complex. 
# Something to do with arrays. 

# STUDY DRILLS 
# Change the prompt variable to something else entirely. 
# Add another argument and use it in your script. 
#Â So that string interpolation can take place.
